# DockerCon 2023 Getting Started Workshop

Welcome to the workshop materials repo! This repository contains many of the supporting files and projects you will need in order to complete the various challenges that lie before you!

## Pre-requisites

You need Docker Desktop installed, preferably the latest version to give you the latest features and performance gains. However, 4.10 or later will suffice.

## Installing the extension

The challenge board (see screenshot below) is available as a Docker extension. To install it, follow one of the following steps:

- [Click this link](https://open.docker.com/extensions/marketplace?extensionId=mikesir87/dockercon23-extension&tag=latest) to install the extension
- OR run this command:

    ```
    docker extension install mikesir87/dockercon23-extension
    ```

After a moment, you should see the extension appear in the left-hand navigation menu.

## Completing the challenges

Once you have the extension installed, you can open it, complete the quick "sign up", and then start working on the various challenges! 

When you think you've got it done, simply click on the **Verify your solution** button. When you do so, various tests will run to validate your solution. If it passes, the points will be awarded!
